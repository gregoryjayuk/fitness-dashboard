# fitness-dashboard

This fitness dashboard will work on any device as it's just html and css.

## Install
1. You will need to first set up the SQLite database
2. I use Markor on my phone to record my logs using the following formate

"# YYYY-MM-DD"
"## Workout Type (e.g. ## Chest)
"### Exercise Name"
"weight, e.g. 60kg"
"- reps, e.g. -  10"

The symbols at the start of each line allow the parser to understand where to store the information and also allow the data to be viewed in any Markdown viewer/editor
